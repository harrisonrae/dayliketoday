      "Kim Jong-nam, the eldest son of former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, was killed in an attack at Malaysia’s low-cost carrier airport, klia2, at around 9:00 a.m. on February 13, 2017. He was scheduled to take a flight to Macau later that morning. Two women, Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong (twenty-eight) and Indonesian Siti Aisyah (twenty-five), were allegedly asked to wipe baby oil on Jong-nam’s face, and were paid $90 for this reality-TV prank. However, twenty minutes after the attack—which was caught on airport security CCTV—Jong-nam was dead. The autopsy identified the “baby oil” as the deadly nerve agent VX. Several North Korean male suspects, said to have been watching when the attack was carried out, all fled the country on the same day. Soon after the murder, an image was publically released.",
      "In 1880, Shelford Bidwell asked himself: what if a picture could be broken into pure information and transmitted as an electronic signal? Bidwell found that if a selenium cell was wired into a simple electrical circuit, with a battery that sent small electrical currents down a wire, it would cause greater or lesser resistance when reacting to direct light. This meant that Bidwell could generate electrical patterns. Bidwell thought this could be used to transmit visual information. To test his idea, Bidwell built two machines, a transmitter and a receiver. Then he painted two simple pictures—black and white silhouettes of a butterfly and a horse. These images are the building blocks for an architecture of surveillance, used to monitor populations.",
      "The second image that Bidwell painted and used for his telephotographic experiment was this horse. In painting these myself I wonder 'what does it mean for someone to take a photo of these bricks with their smartphone?' I wonder this because in painting the butterfly and the horse I am reproducing a history. In the viewer participating with their phone they are also a part of reproducing this history of machine-generated images. But I'm not sure what this means. 'Am I doing something that is worthwhile?' That is a question I think about when looking back on reproducing these machine-generated images.",
      "The QR code is how you got here. This is a different kind of machine-generated image. A wikipedia article traced them back to 1994; a way to store more information than a traditional barcode. I think QR codes are an interesting way to demonstrate the unconscious understanding among people that machine-generated imagges have clear demands of us. Addiionally, we mostly meet their expectations as we raise our phones to connect and decode.",
      "This is an aerial photograph taken by a drone in January 2025. The image shows displaced Palestinians returning to Rafah, a day after the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect. This ceasefire included countless violations, and ended officially in March later that year when Netanyahu stated that combat had resumed in full force. This drone photograph (credited to Mohammad Abu Samra of the Associated Press) is using the same technology that is surveilling, monitoring and killing the Palestinian population. This same technology is being used in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine."
